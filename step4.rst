   |Global_Search|

.. tip::
		 If you want to just search **Apps** or **Analyses** or **Data**, use
		 the filter drop-down next to Search field to select the appropriate filter.

4. You can click on the desired result from the drop-down.

.. tip::

		 By default, only the top **10 results** are shown. If you want to
		 see all the results associated with a *search term*,
		 hit *enter* key after the *search term* or select the option similar to *View all analyses results for fasta* from the
		 results drop-down.
