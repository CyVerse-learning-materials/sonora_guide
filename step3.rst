Browsing Data in the Discovery Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. To see more information, press the :guilabel:`&Customize Columns` button to
show more columns in the display, such as size or modification date.

2. If the folder you're viewing has many items in it, the bottom of the screen
provides a way to change between pages and set the number of items displayed per page.

3. Click on the name of a subfolder to open that folder. Near the top of the
screen, you should see breadcrumbs that indicate the folder you're viewing and its parent folders.

4. From the top left, at the start of the breadcrumbs, you may select another
root folder to view from among your home folder, "Shared With Me", "Community Data", and Trash.

Alternatively, click the three-dots menu to the right edge in a file or folder's row, and click the :guilabel:`&Details` button there to see specific information about the selected item, to copy the path to the item, to add tags to the item, or to set a file's info type.

3. Click "Permissions" to see your own permissions on the item, and those of
other users.
