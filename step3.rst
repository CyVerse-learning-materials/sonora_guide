Manage Data in Sonora Discovery Environment
-------------------------------------------

To manage data in Sonora, begin by clicking on the Data icon in the sidebar. You may be prompted to log in.
Once logged in, you should be shown your own home directory, in order with folders first, then alphabetically.

1. To see more information, press the :guilabel:`&Customize Columns` button to show more columns in the display,
   such as size or modification date. 

2. If the folder you're viewing has many items in it, the bottom of the screen provides a way to change
   between pages and set the number of items displayed per page.

3. Click on the name of a subfolder to open that folder. Near the top of the screen, you should see breadcrumbs
   that indicate the subfolder.

4. From the top left, at the start of the breadcrumbs, you may select another root folder to view from
   among your home folder, "Shared With Me", "Community Data", and Trash.

5. Click the checkbox next to a file or folder to select it. When you have, there will be a button near the top right
   labeled :guilabel:`&Details`. Alternatively, click the three-dots menu to the right edge in a file or folder's row,
   and click the :guilabel:`&Details` button there.
   
6. Click the :guilabel:`&Details` button to see specific information about the selected item,
   to copy the path to the item, to add tags to the item, or to set a file's info type.

7. Click "Permissions" to see your own permissions on the item, and those of other users.
