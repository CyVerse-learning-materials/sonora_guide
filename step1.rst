Logging into the Discovery Environment (DE)
-------------------------------------------

The Discovery Environment (DE) was designed to be an all-purpose bioinformatics workbench â€“ tailored to the needs of
scientists who have data to analyze but who may not have command line expertise. For example, many popular
bioinformatics analyses and workflows (such as genome assembly, RNA-Seq, phylogeny methods, and GWAS) can be done from
start to finish within the DE.

**Some things to remember about the DE**

- Your analyses are not limited by your computer. All computation in the DE runs on CyVerse resources. You can connect
  from your laptop or phone and launch jobs large and small.
- Once you launch a job it will run until completion. You can logout once a job is launched; by default, you will get an
  email notification when the job completes.

*Logging In*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you first navigate to |the DE|, you'll be presented with the Dashboard view. This view contains links to news and
videos related to CyVerse, along with a list of recently added applications that can be used to perform computational
analyses. You can explore this information as much as you like, but you must log in before you can perform any tasks.

You may log in by clicking the profile icon in the upper right-hand corner of the DE, orby clicking `SIGN IN` when you
encounter a message such as this one:

|DE Login Required|

After entering your username and password, you'll be directed back to the view that you were previously on. For example,
if you were on the Apps view then clicked `SIGN IN`, then you'll return to the Apps view after entering your
credentials. If you don't have an account yet or you've forgotten your password, you can visit the |CyVerse User Portal|
to create an account or reset your password.
