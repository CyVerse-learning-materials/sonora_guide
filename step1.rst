Logging into the Discovery Environment (DE)
-------------------------------------------

The Discovery Environment (DE) was designed as an all-purpose bioinformatics workbench â€“ tailored to the needs of
scientists with data to analyze but who may not have command line expertise to run the software. For example, you can run many popular
bioinformatics analyses and workflows, such as genome assembly, RNA-Seq analyses, phylogeny methods, GWAS, etc., from
start to finish using only the DE's web interface.

**Some things to remember about the DE**

- Your analyses are not limited by your computer. All computations in the DE run on CyVerse resources, enabling you to connect
  from your laptop or phone and launch jobs large and small.
- Once you launch a job (an app), it will run until completion. You can logout after launching a job; an automated
  email notification will be sent to you when the job is completed.

*Logging In*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you first navigate to |the DE|, you'll see the Dashboard view. This view contains links to news and
CyVerse videos, along with a list of recently added applications you can use to perform computational
analyses. The Dashboard's left sidebar shows icons for Data, Apps, Analyses, Teams, and Help. You can explore the Dashboard information as much as you like, but you must log in to perform any tasks.

To log in, click the profile icon in the upper right-hand corner of the DE, or click `SIGN IN` when you
encounter a message such as this one:

|DE Login Required|

After entering your username and password, you'll be returned to the view that you were previously on. For example,
if you were on the Apps view then clicked `SIGN IN`, you'll return to the Apps view after signing in. To get an account or to reset your password, visit the |CyVerse User Portal|.
